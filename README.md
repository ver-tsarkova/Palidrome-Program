# Palidrome-Program
A program that examines a user-entered string to determine if it's a palindrome.

A palindrome is a word that is spelled the same forward and backward, such as "radar", "madam", or "abba" Your program should ask the user to enter a word, and then tell the user whether or not that word is a palindrome.

- Your program doesn't need to determine whether or not the word is in the English language. So for example your program would      determine that the word "abcdefghijjihgfedcba" is a palindrome.
- You can assume that the word is made up of lower-case letters only.
- Please use at least two methods in addition to "main". For example, you may want to write a method to input the word, and a boolean method to determine if the string is a palindrome. Make sure to include comments with each method. Also, declare all variables inside your methods (no class-level variables).
- Your program needs to include at least one loop, going through each character in the string.
